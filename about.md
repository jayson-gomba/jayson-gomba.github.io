# About

My name is Jayson Gomba, I have a undergradute and postgradute degree in Computer Science, and currently work as an IT Systems Developer at the NHS. This is a blog for my journey in how to improve my learning with learning how to learn, problem solving and how to think like a programmer and getting into machine learning and deep learning.
