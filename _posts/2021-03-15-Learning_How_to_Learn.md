   2. Try to understand the basic idea(s) of the information you want to chunk
   3. Gain the context of the information by practicing the information you want to chunk
 * Simple recall, by looking away at the information and trying to recall what you have just read can help the chunking process
 * Transfer is the idea that chunks you have mastered in one area can help you easily learn and create new chunks in different areas
 * Interleave your learning by practicing different concepts, approaches and techniques all in one session
