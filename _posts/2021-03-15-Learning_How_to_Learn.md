# Learning How to Learn

### Learning
  * Focused mode is where you intensely focus the material focusing on the details
  * Diffuse mode is where in a more relaxed state you allow your mind to look at the bigger picture of the material
  * Analogues help in learning by making clearer the nature of the things being compared 
  * Metaphors can help in learning by describing a concept in a way that isn't literally true, but helps explain an idea or make comparisons  
  * The Pomodoro Technique is when you set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on the material in those 25 minutes without any distractions and then reward yourself after the 25 minutes are over. It can help with procrastination by getting you started on learning the material
  * Practice and Repatition can strengthen your neural pathways when trying to learn new things 
  * Working memory is like a blackboard
  * Long term memory is like a storage warehouse
  * The importance of sleep in learning
### Chunking
 * Chunks are pieces of information bound together through use and through meaning
 * Chunks can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time are single easy to access items that you can slot into your working memory
 * To create a chunk: 
   1. Focus on the material you want to chunk
   2. Try to understand the basic idea(s) of the material you want to chunk
   3. Gain the context of the material by practicing the material you want to chunk
 * Simple recall, by looking away at the material and trying to recall what you have just read can help the chunking process
 * Transfer is the idea that chunks you have mastered in one area can help you easily learn and create new chunks in different areas
 * Interleave your learning by practicing different concepts, approaches and techniques all in one session
 * Illusions of competence - learn to recognize when you are fooling yourself about whether you are actually learning the material. Doing mini-tests(Simple recall) can help alleviate the illusion of competence
 * Making mistakes are good at helping you learn, they can allow you to catch illusions of competence
 * Avoid only practicing on the easy stuff
 * Deliberately practice on the difficult stuff to gain full mastery of the material
 * Einstellung
### Procrastination and Memory
#### Tackling Procrastination
 * Eat your frogs first every day
 * Track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work
 * Commit yourself to certain routines and task each day
 * Write your planned tasks out the night before
 * Arrange your work into a series of small challenges
 * Always make sure you and your zombies get lots of rewards
 * Take a few minutes to savor the feeling of happiness and triumph, which gives your brain a chance to temporarily switch from focus to diffuse mode
 * Deliberately delay rewards until you have finished a task
 * Watch for procrastination cues
 * Gain trust in your new system
 * Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate
#### Deep dive into Memory
* For long term memory, you need to practice and repeat in order to help store items you can retrieve them more easily
* Practicing and repeating all in one day is a bad idea, its better to extend your practice over several days
* Working memory is like a blackboard which has information that quickly fades
* You can only hold four items in your working memory
* When you master the material in some sense it is compacted so that the material can occupy less space in your working memory when you do bring it to mind
* This frees up your mental thinking space so that it can more easily grapple with other ideas
* We have outstanding visual and spatial memory which we can tap into which can help improve your memory
* This can be done by trying to make a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember
* Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material
* The memory palace technique, placing memorable images in a scene that is familiar to you allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system, providing a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember.
