# Learning How to Learn

### Learning
  * Focused mode is where you intensely focus the material focusing on the details
  * Diffuse mode is where in a more relaxed state you allow your mind to look at the bigger picture of the material
  * Analogues help in learning by making clearer the nature of the things being compared 
  * Metaphors can help in learning by describing a concept in a way that isn't literally true, but helps explain an idea or make comparisons  
  * The Pomodoro Technique is when you set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on the material in those 25 minutes without any distractions and then reward yourself after the 25 minutes are over. It can help with procrastination by getting you started on learning the material
  * Practice and Repatition can strengthen your neural pathways when trying to learn new things 
  * Working memory is like a blackboard
  * Long term memory is like a storage warehouse
  * The importance of sleep in learning
### Chunking

 * Chunks can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time are single easy to access items that you can slot into your working memory
 * To create a chunk: 
   1. Focus on the material you want to chunk
   2. Try to understand the basic idea(s) of the material you want to chunk
   3. Gain the context of the material by practicing the material you want to chunk
 * Simple recall, by looking away at the material and trying to recall what you have just read can help the chunking process
 * Transfer is the idea that chunks you have mastered in one area can help you easily learn and create new chunks in different areas
 * Interleave your learning by practicing different concepts, approaches and techniques all in one session

 * Making mistakes are good at helping you learn, they can allow you to catch illusions of competence
 * Avoid only practicing on the easy stuff
 * Deliberately practice on the difficult stuff to gain full mastery of the material
