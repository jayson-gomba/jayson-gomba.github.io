# Learning How to Learn

### Learning
  * **Focused mode** is when you concentrate intently on smething you are trying to learn or to understand.
  * **Diffuse mode** is when you look at things broadly from a very different, big picture perspective.
  * **Metaphors** and **Analogies** can help in learning by realzing that one thing is somehow simialr to another and making comparisons between concept(s) in a way that aren't literally true, but helps explain the concept(s).
  * The **Pomodoro Technique** involves a 25 minute stretch of focused concentration, followed by a bit of mental relaxation. It can help with tackling procrastination.
  * It's through **practice** and **repatition** that we can help strengthen and enhance the neural structures we are building as we are learning some thing new. 
  * They are _four slots_ in our **working memory**. Things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind, however if we practiced and repeated something long enought we can get it into our **long term memory** and call it up later if we need it.
  * The importance of sleep in washing away the toxins that develop during our day's activities which can impair our learning.
### Chunking
 * Chunks are pieces of information bound together through use and through meaning.
 * Chunks can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time are single easy to access items that you can slot into your working memory.
 * To create a chunk: 
   1. Focus on the material you want to chunk.
   2. Try to understand the basic idea(s) of the material you want to chunk.
   3. Gain the context of the material by practicing the material you want to chunk.
 * Simple recall, by looking away at the material and trying to recall what you have just read can help the chunking process.
 * Transfer is the idea that chunks you have mastered in one area can help you easily learn and create new chunks in different areas.
 * Interleave your learning by practicing different concepts, approaches and techniques all in one session.
 * Illusions of competence - learn to recognize when you are fooling yourself about whether you are actually learning the material. Doing mini-tests(Simple recall) can help alleviate the illusion of competence.
 * Making mistakes are good at helping you learn, they can allow you to catch illusions of competence.
 * Avoid only practicing on the easy stuff.
 * Deliberately practice on the difficult stuff to gain full mastery of the material.
 * Einstellung
### Procrastination and Memory
#### Tackling Procrastination
 * Eat your frogs first every day.
 * Use the **Pomodoro Technique**
 * Track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work.
 * Commit yourself to certain routines and task each day.
 * Write your planned tasks out the night before.
 * Arrange your work into a series of small challenges.
 * Always make sure you and your zombies get lots of rewards.
 * Take a few minutes to savor the feeling of happiness and triumph, which gives your brain a chance to temporarily switch from focus mode to diffuse mode.
 * Deliberately delay rewards until you have finished a task.
 * Watch for procrastination cues.
 * Gain trust in your new system.
 * Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate.
#### Deep dive into Memory
* For long term memory, you need to practice and repeat in order to help store items so that you can retrieve them more easily.
* Practicing and repeating all in one day is a bad idea, its better to extend your practice over several days.
* Working memory is like a blackboard which has information that quickly fades.
* You can only hold four items in your working memory.
* When you master the material in some sense it is compacted so that the material can occupy less space in your working memory when you do bring it to mind.
* This frees up your mental thinking space so that it can more easily grapple with other ideas.
* We have outstanding visual and spatial memory which we can tap into which can help improve your memory.
* This can be done by trying to make a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember.
* Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material.
* The memory palace technique, placing memorable images in a scene that is familiar to you allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system, providing a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember.
### Renaissance Learning
* One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but more easily understand concepts in many different fields, is to create a metaphor or analogy. Often, the more visual, the better.
* Instead of whizzing through a problem, take a mental breath and then revisit what you've done with the bigger picture in mind, to see whether it makes sense.
* Overconfidence in your results can result from using only one mode of thinking. By making it a point to discuss them with others, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray.
* Counterintuitive strategies such as the hard start jump to easy technique, can give your brain a chance to reflect on harder challenges even as you're focusing on other more straightforward problems.
